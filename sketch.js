//IN p5.js, we write "interactive"
// setup() - runs once, at start
// draw() - runs over and over(after setup)
// targeting 60 times per second  
//SCREEN IS UPDATED AT BOTTOM OF DRAW
//


function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw() {
  background(0); //WIPES THE SCREEN}
